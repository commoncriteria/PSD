  <section title="Overview" id="ppoverview">
    This Protection Profile (PP) describes common security requirements for Peripheral Sharing Devices
    (PSDs). A PSD is a device that provides a mechanism for securely connecting a set of peripherals to one or
    more attached computers. This Base‐PP may be used in conjunction with one or more PP‐Modules that
    describe the specific functional interfaces of that PSD type (i.e., audio, video, keyboard, user
    authentication device, or mouse), as described in section 2.

    <section title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation" id="TOEdescription">
      In the context of this PP, a PSD is an IT product for connecting one or more peripheral devices to one or
      more computers such that data cannot flow between computers by way of the peripherals or the PSD.
      Examples of PSDs that can claim compliance to this PP include Keyboard, Video, Mouse (KVM) switches;
      Keyboard, Mouse (KM) switches; and Isolators.<h:br/><h:br/>
      A PSD may be composed of one or more hardware components or platforms, and its software or
      firmware. It may include cables and accessories. PSDs that support more than one computer include a
      user interface that includes a visible indication of the selected computer interface and a mechanism for
      changing the selected computer interface. The user interface can be implemented on the chassis of the
      PSD using, for example, a touch screen or lights and buttons, or as part of a wired remote control.<h:br/><h:br/>
      An isolator or filter PSD is a device that provides the same security functions as a KVM but only to a single
      connected computer. Isolators do not require continuous display of the active interface.
      <section title="TOE Boundary" id="TOEboundary">
        The TOE boundary is limited to the PSD itself. The TOE’s operational environment consists of one or more
        connected peripherals or computers. The typical usage of a multi‐computer PSD involves mapping
        interfaces between multiple computers such that the user is able to interact with the selected computers.<h:br/><h:br/>
        In this case, the TOE includes a user interface that allows a user to select the active computer. The user
        interface includes an indicator identifying the currently selected computer. Typical PSD usage is illustrated
        in Figure 1 below.        
        <figure entity="images/Toe.png" title="General TOE " id="toe"/> <comment>Need to add figure here.</comment>
          <section title="PSD Compliance Guidelines">
            Connected peripheral devices, computer platforms, and connecting cables are not covered under this PP,
            but may be addressed by another PP. Nevertheless, testing of the TOE requires a complete setup that
            includes computers, cables, and peripheral devices.<h:br/><h:br/>
            PSDs covered by this PP: <h:ul>
              <h:li>May support one or more types of peripherals specified in the PP‐Modules that extend this PP
              (e.g., video display or keyboard/mouse).</h:li>
              <h:li>Must be connected to one or more computers.</h:li>
              <h:li>May comprise one or more connected sub‐systems (e.g., one KM device and one video device
              connected with cables or wires).</h:li>
              <h:li>Must not support more than one of each peripheral device type except for display or audio output
              devices.</h:li>
              <h:li>Must support only single users; a PSD may not be shared among users.</h:li>
            </h:ul>
            The following list includes additional characteristics that a conformant TOE must have or may have:<h:ul>
              <h:li>PSD connected devices are limited as per the Peripheral Device Connections (Appendix E).</h:li>
              <h:li>A single user may use more than one PSD instance at a time.</h:li>
              <h:li>The PSD monitoring and control functions are optional. If supported, these functions shall be builtin
                to the PSD chassis or implemented as part of a wired remote control.</h:li>
              <h:li>PSD indicators must be implemented in such a way as to be visible to the user at all times.</h:li>
              <h:li>PSDs may have non‐tactile user controls (e.g., multi‐touch windows).</h:li>
              <h:li>Connected Computers may have one or more peripheral devices that bypass the PSD (i.e.,
                peripherals that are connected directly to a computer).</h:li>
              <h:li>The PSD user display may present one‐to‐many computers’ video output simultaneously if
                displays are a peripheral type supported by the TOE.</h:li>
        </h:ul>

    <section title="Use Cases" id="sec-usecases">
      The following use cases are examples of PSDs covered by this PP.
      <usecases>
        <usecase title="Single User with PSD, Local Monitoring, and Local Control" id="supsd-loc-mon-loc-con">
          <config>
            <ref-id><comment>Add Single user with PSD, local monitoring, and local control Figure here</comment></ref-id>            
          </config>
            <description>In this use case, the user controls the PSD through a user interface on the PSD itself or through
            a directly connected remote controller. Peripheral devices are connected directly to the PSD
            using cables. Since the PSD resides in close physical proximity to the user, the user is expected
            to have physical access and full visibility of the PSD monitoring and control functions.<h:br/><h:br/>
            PSDs implementing this use case may support any type of supported peripheral as defined in this
            PP and its associated PP‐Modules.<h:br/><h:br/>
            Note that the Operational Environment of this PSD may include peripherals that are connected
            directly to the connected computers (unconnected to the PSD) and multiple peripherals of the
            same type (for display or audio output only) each connected to the PSD, as shown in the figures
            below:
              <config>
                <ref-id><comment>Add Single user with KM PSDand peripherals connected directly to computers Figure here</comment></ref-id>
                <ref-id><comment>Add Single user with PSD and multiple peripherals of the same type Figure here</comment></ref-id>
              </config>              
            </description>
        </usecase>
        <usecase title="Single User with PSD and a Single Computer (Isolator or Filter)" id="supsd-sin-comp-iso-or-fil">
          <config>
            <ref-id><comment>Add Single User with PSD and a Single Computer (Isolator or Filter) Figure here</comment></ref-id>            
          </config>          
          <description>
            In this use case, the PSD sits between a set of connected peripherals and a single connected
            computer. The connected computer may change over time, such as different laptops connected
            to an Isolator or Filter that persistently resides in a conference room. Once again, this use case
            does not specifically mandate or exclude the use of any one type of peripheral that is defined by
            this PP and its PP‐Modules.
          </description>
        </usecase>
        <usecase title="PSD with Single Integrated Video Display (Combiner or Multi-Viewer)" id="psd-sin-int-vid-disp-comb-or-mv">
          <config>
            <ref-id><comment>Add PSD with Single Integrated Video Display (Combiner or Multi-Viewer) Figure here</comment></ref-id>            
          </config>
          <description>
            A Combiner is used to simultaneously display output from multiple connected computers to one or more
            display devices. A Combiner PSD may combine the display output from multiple connected computers
            onto a single monitor (as shown in Figure 6 above) or output the display from one connected computer
            to be spanned onto multiple tiled or overlapping displays (e.g., a video wall). Any PSD TOE that claims to
            support this use case must have the ability to support display peripherals. Other supported peripherals
            can be claimed at the ST author’s discretion.

                 where the anti‐tampering functionality has been activated.<h:br/><h:br/>

               </Guidance>
               <Tests>
                 In the following testing the evaluator shall attempt to gain physical access to
                 the TOE internal circuitry (enough access to allow the insertion of tools to
                 tamper with the internal circuitry). The TOE anti‐ tampering function is
                 expected to trigger, causing an irreversible change to the TOE functionality.
                 The evaluator then shall verify that the anti‐tampering triggering provides
                 the expected user indications and also disables the TOE.<h:br/><h:br/>
                 TOE disabling means that the user would not be able to use the TOE for any
                 purpose – all peripheral devices and computers are isolated.<h:br/><h:br/>
                 Note that it is obvious that if the TOE was physically tampered with, then the
                 attacker may easily circumvent the tamper indication means (for example
                 cut the relevant TOE front panel wires). Nevertheless, the following test
                 verifies that the user would be unable to ignore the TOE tampering
                 indications and resume normal work.<h:br/><h:br/>

                 permanently disabled and provides the proper indication that it has been
                 tampered with in accordance with the operational user guidance.</h:li>
                 <h:li>[conditional: this step is applicable for TOEs having a remote

                 TOE is both permanently disabled and provides the proper indication that it
                 has been tampered with in accordance with the operational user guidance.</h:li>
                 <h:li>The evaluator shall attempt to access the TOE settings to reset the

            indicators, and concerns TOEs with multiple authorized switching mechanisms
            that have distinct switching status indicators. Such indicators must never
            convey conflicting information to the user regarding the currently selected
            interfaces. In general, all indicators must always reflect the same status. It is
            permissible for the most recently used switching mechanism to reflect the
            current status while all other indicators to reflect no status. It is also permissible
            for a TOE that supports split control (i.e., different peripherals pointing to
            different computers) to have separate indicators for individual peripherals.
            Note however that a TOE that supports keyboard/mouse peripherals is not
            permitted to have the keyboard and mouse peripherals split in this manner, as
            per the requirements in the PP‐Module for Keyboard/Mouse (KM) Devices.<h:br/><h:br/>

      The Security Objectives in <xref to="Security_Objectives"/> were constructed to address threats identified in
      <xref to="Threats"/>. The Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) in <xref to="SFRs"/> are a formal instantiation
      of the Security Objectives. The PP identifies the Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) to frame the extent to
      which the evaluator assesses the documentation applicable for the evaluation and performs independent testing.<h:br/><h:br/>
      This section lists the set of SARs from CC part 3 that are required in evaluations against this PP. Individual 
      Assurance Activities to be performed are specified both in <xref to="SFRs"/> as well as in this section.<h:br/><h:br/>
      The general model for evaluation of OSs against STs written to conform to this PP is as follows.<h:br/><h:br/>
      After the  ST has been approved for evaluation, the TSEF will obtain the OS, supporting environmental IT, and the
      administrative/user guides for the OS. The ITSEF is expected to perform actions mandated by the Common Evaluation
      Methodology (CEM) for the ASE and ALC SARs. The ITSEF also performs the Assurance Activities contained within 
      <xref to="SFRs"/>, which are intended to be an interpretation of the other CEM assurance requirements as they 
      apply to the specific technology instantiated in the OS. The Assurance Activities that are captured in 
      <xref to="SFRs"/> also provide clarification as to what the developer needs to provide to demonstrate the OS is 
      compliant with the PP.<h:br/><h:br/>
      The TOE security assurance requirements are identified in <xref to="sar"/>.

              The test report (which could just be an annotated version of the test plan) details
              the activities that took place when the test procedures were executed, and includes
              the actual results of the tests. This shall be a cumulative account, so if there was a

        evaluator will not be expected to test for these vulnerabilities in the OS. The labs will be expected to comment on the likelihood of these vulnerabilities given
        the documentation provided by the vendor. This information will be used in the development
        of penetration testing tools and for the development of future protection profiles.

            <aactivity>The evaluator will generate a report to document their
              findings with respect to this requirement. This report could physically be part of the
              overall test report mentioned in ATE_IND, or a separate document. The evaluator
              performs a search of public information to find vulnerabilities that have been found
              in similar applications with a particular focus on network protocols the application
              uses and document formats it parses. 
              The evaluator documents the sources consulted and
              the vulnerabilities found in the report.

              For each vulnerability found, the evaluator
              either provides a rationale with respect to its non-applicability, or the evaluator
              formulates a test (using the guidelines provided in ATE_IND) to confirm the
              vulnerability, if suitable. Suitability is determined by assessing the attack vector
              needed to take advantage of the vulnerability. If exploiting the vulnerability
              requires expert skills and an electron microscope, for instance, then a test would not
              be suitable and an appropriate justification would be formulated.</aactivity>

  <section title="Overview" id="ppoverview">
    This Protection Profile (PP) describes common security requirements for Peripheral Sharing Devices
    (PSDs). A PSD is a device that provides a mechanism for securely connecting a set of peripherals to one or
    more attached computers. This Base‐PP may be used in conjunction with one or more PP‐Modules that
    describe the specific functional interfaces of that PSD type (i.e., audio, video, keyboard, user
    authentication device, or mouse), as described in section 2.

    <section title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation" id="TOEdescription">
      In the context of this PP, a PSD is an IT product for connecting one or more peripheral devices to one or
      more computers such that data cannot flow between computers by way of the peripherals or the PSD.
      Examples of PSDs that can claim compliance to this PP include Keyboard, Video, Mouse (KVM) switches;
      Keyboard, Mouse (KM) switches; and Isolators.<h:br/><h:br/>
      Examples of devices that cannot claim conformance to this PP include Extenders.<h:br/><h:br/>
      A PSD may be composed of one or more hardware components or platforms, and its software or
      firmware. It may include cables and accessories. PSDs that support more than one computer include a
      user interface that includes a visible indication of the selected computer interface and a mechanism for
      changing the selected computer interface. The user interface can be implemented on the chassis of the
      PSD using, for example, a touch screen or lights and buttons, or as part of a wired remote control.<h:br/><h:br/>
      An isolator or filter PSD is a device that provides the same security functions as a KVM but only to a single
      connected computer. Isolators do not require continuous display of the active interface.
      <section title="TOE Boundary" id="TOEboundary">
        The TOE boundary is limited to the PSD itself. The TOE’s operational environment consists of one or more
        connected peripherals or computers. The typical usage of a multi‐computer PSD involves mapping
        interfaces between multiple computers such that the user is able to interact with the selected computers.<h:br/><h:br/>
        In this case, the TOE includes a user interface that allows a user to select the active computer. The user
        interface includes an indicator identifying the currently selected computer. Typical PSD usage is illustrated
        in Figure 1 below.        
        <figure entity="images/Toe.png" title="General TOE " id="toe"/>
          <section title="PSD Compliance Guidelines">
            Connected peripheral devices, computer platforms, and connecting cables are not covered under this PP,
            but may be addressed by another PP. Nevertheless, testing of the TOE requires a complete setup that
            includes computers, cables, and peripheral devices.<h:br/><h:br/>
            PSDs covered by this PP: <h:ul>
              <h:li>May support one or more types of peripherals specified in the PP‐Modules that extend this PP
              (e.g., video display or keyboard and mouse).</h:li>
              <h:li>Must be connected to one or more computers.</h:li>
              <h:li>May comprise one or more connected sub‐systems (e.g., one KM device and one video device
              connected with cables or wires).</h:li>
              <h:li>Must not support more than one of each peripheral device type except for display or audio output
              devices.</h:li>
              <h:li>Must support only single users; a PSD may not be shared among users.</h:li>
            </h:ul>
            The following list includes additional characteristics that a conformant TOE must have or may have:<h:ul>
              <h:li>PSD connected devices are limited as per the Peripheral Device Connections (Appendix E).</h:li>
              <h:li>A single user may use more than one PSD instance at a time.</h:li>
              <h:li>The PSD monitoring and control functions are optional. If supported, these functions shall be built-in
                to the PSD chassis or implemented as part of a wired remote control.</h:li>
              <h:li>PSD indicators must be implemented in such a way as to be visible to the user at all times.</h:li>
              <h:li>PSDs may have non‐tactile user controls (e.g., multi‐touch windows).</h:li>
              <h:li>Connected Computers may have one or more peripheral devices that bypass the PSD (i.e.,
                peripherals that are connected directly to a computer).</h:li>
              <h:li>The PSD user display may present one‐to‐many computers’ video output simultaneously if
                displays are a peripheral type supported by the TOE.</h:li>
        </h:ul>

    <section title="Use Cases" id="sec-usecases">
      The following use cases are examples of PSDs covered by this PP.
      <usecases>
        <usecase title="Single User with PSD, Local Monitoring, and Local Control" id="supsd-loc-mon-loc-con">
            <description>
            <figure entity="images/usecase1a sing psd local.png" title="Single User with PSD, Local
                Monitoring, and Local Control" id="singpsdlocal"/>
            In this use case, the user controls the PSD through a user interface on the PSD itself or through
            a directly connected remote controller. Peripheral devices are connected directly to the PSD
            using cables. Since the PSD resides in close physical proximity to the user, the user is expected
            to have physical access and full visibility of the PSD monitoring and control functions.<h:br/><h:br/>
            PSDs implementing this use case may support any type of supported peripheral as defined in this
            PP and its associated PP‐Modules.<h:br/><h:br/>
            Note that the Operational Environment of this PSD may include peripherals that are connected
            directly to the connected computers (unconnected to the PSD) and multiple peripherals of the
            same type (for display or audio output only) each connected to the PSD, as shown in the figures
            below:       
              <figure entity="images/usecase1b sing km psd and periph.png" title="Single User with
                KM PSD and Peripherals Connected Directly to Computers" id="singkmpsdperiph"/> 
              <figure entity="images/usecase1c sing km psd and periph.png" title="Single User with
                KM PSD and Peripherals Connected Directly to Computers" id="singkmpsdperiph"/>
              
            </description>
        </usecase>
        <usecase title="Single User with PSD and a Single Computer (Isolator or Filter)" id="supsd-sin-comp-iso-or-fil">
          <description>
            <figure entity="images/usecase2 sing psd sing.png" title="PSD with Single Integhrated
              Video Display (Combiner or Multi-Viewer" id="singpsdsing"/>
            In this use case, the PSD sits between a set of connected peripherals and a single connected
            computer. The connected computer may change over time, such as different laptops connected
            to an Isolator or Filter that persistently resides in a conference room. Once again, this use case
            does not specifically mandate or exclude the use of any one type of peripheral that is defined by
            this PP and its PP‐Modules.
          </description>
        </usecase>
        <usecase title="PSD with Single Integrated Video Display (Combiner or Multi-Viewer)" id="psd-sin-int-vid-disp-comb-or-mv">

              Video Display (Combiner or Multi-Viewer)" id="singpsdsing"/>
            A Combiner is used to simultaneously display output from multiple connected computers to one or more
            display devices. A Combiner PSD may combine the display output from multiple connected computers
            onto a single monitor (as shown in Figure 6 above) or output the display from one connected computer
            to be spanned onto multiple tiled or overlapping displays (e.g., a video wall). Any PSD TOE that claims to
            support this use case must have the ability to support display peripherals. Other supported peripherals
            can be claimed at the ST author’s discretion.
          </description>          
        </usecase>
        <usecase id="invalidusecase" title="[Invalid Use Case] Single User with PSD, Without Complete Local Monitoring or
          Local Control (Extender)">
          <description>In this use case, the user controls the portion of PSD into which the peripherals are connected but
            is not necessarily in direct control of the entirety of the PSD or the connected computer. Since the full PSD
            does not necessarily reside in close physical proximity to the user, the user is not expected to have physical
            access and full visibility of the PSD monitoring and control functions.</description>

    <section title="Implementation-Based Features" id="sec-features">

          <description>The TSF implements a management interface for its configuration. This generally exists when it is possible to configure the device filtration behavior of the TOE to explicitly allow or reject certain devices. When this functionality is implemented, it is expected that an interface exists that requires an authorized user to authenticate to the TOE, and that an audit log with reliable timestamps be generated to record the configuration activities performed against the TOE.</description>

            FTA_CIN_EXT.1.3’s selection of "multiple indicators which never display

            indicators, and concerns TOEs with multiple authorized switching mechanisms
            that have distinct switching status indicators. Such indicators must never
            convey conflicting information to the user regarding the currently selected
            interfaces. In general, all indicators must always reflect the same status. It is
            permissible for the most recently used switching mechanism to reflect the
            current status while all other indicators to reflect no status. It is also permissible
            for a TOE that supports split control (i.e., different peripherals pointing to
            different computers) to have separate indicators for individual peripherals.
            Note however that a TOE that supports keyboard and mouse peripherals is not
            permitted to have the keyboard and mouse peripherals split in this manner, as
            per the requirements in the PP‐Module for Keyboard/Mouse (KM) Devices.<h:br/><h:br/>

    <section title="Security Assurance Requirements" id="SARs">
      The Security Objectives for the TOE in Section 4.1 were constructed to address threats identified in
      Section 3.1. The Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) in Section 5.1 are a formal instantiation of the
      Security Objectives. The SARs were chosen based on the complexity of the products that are anticipated
      to be evaluated against this PP as well as the expected level of sophistication and access that an attacker
      would have if the TOE is deployed in an environment that satisfies the environmental security objectives
      in this PP.<h:br/><h:br/>
      This section lists the set of SARs drawn from CC Part 3 that are required in evaluations against this PP.
      Individual Evaluation Activities to be performed are specified both in Section 5.1 as well as in this section.<h:br/><h:br/>
      The general model for evaluation of TOEs against STs written to conform to this PP is as follows:<h:br/><h:br/>
      After the ST has been approved for evaluation, the Common Criteria Testing Laboratory (CCTL) will obtain
      the TOE, supporting IT environmental, and the administrative/user guides for the TOE. The CCTL is
      expected to perform actions mandated by the Common Evaluation Methodology (CEM) for the ASE and
      ALC SARs. The CCTL also performs the Evaluation Activities contained within Section 5.1, which are
      intended to be an interpretation of the other CEM assurance requirements as they apply to the specific
      technology instantiated in the TOE. The Evaluation Activities that are captured in Section 5.1 also provide
      clarification as to what the developer needs to provide to demonstrate the TOE is compliant with the PP.<h:br/><h:br/>
      The TOE security assurance requirements are identified in <xref to="sar"/>.

          describes the Target Security Functions Interfaces (TSFIs). It is not necessary to have a formal or complete
          specification of these interfaces. Additionally, because TOEs conforming to this PP will necessarily have 
          interfaces to the Operational Environment that are not directly able to be invoked by TOE users, there is
          little point specifying that such interfaces be described in and of themselves since only indirect testing
          of such interfaces may be possible. For this PP, the activities for this family should focus on understanding
          the interfaces presented in the TSS in response to the functional requirements and the interfaces presented
          in the AGD documentation. No additional "functional specification" documentation is necessary to satisfy the
          Evaluation Activities specified.<h:br/><h:br/>
          The interfaces that need to be evaluated are characterized through the information needed to perform

        The former is done through the ATE_IND family, while the latter is through the AVA_VAN
        family. At the assurance level specified in this PP, testing is based on advertised
        functionality and interfaces with dependency on the availability of design information. One
        of the primary outputs of the evaluation process is the test report as specified in the
        following requirements.

              <xref to="bibCEM"/> and the body of this PP’s Assurance Activities.<h:br/> <h:br/>
              While it is not necessary to have one test case per test listed in an Assurance Activity, the
              evaluator must document in the test plan that each applicable testing requirement in
              the ST is covered. The test plan identifies the platforms to be
              tested, and for those platforms not included in the test plan but included in the
                ST, the test plan provides a justification for not testing the
              platforms. This justification must address the differences between the tested
              platforms and the untested platforms, and make an argument that the differences do not
              affect the testing to be performed. It is not sufficient to merely assert that the
              differences have no affect; rationale must be provided. If all platforms claimed in
              the ST are tested, then no rationale is necessary. The test plan
              describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and any setup that is
              necessary beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation. It should be noted that
              the evaluator is expected to follow the AGD documentation for installation and setup
              of each platform either as part of a test or as a standard pre-test condition. This
              may include special test drivers or tools. For each driver or tool, an argument (not
              just an assertion) should be provided that the driver or tool will not adversely
              affect the performance of the functionality by the TOE and its
              platform.<h:br/><h:br/>
              This also includes the configuration of the cryptographic engine to be
              used. The cryptographic algorithms implemented by this engine are those specified by
              this PP and used by the cryptographic protocols being evaluated (IPsec, TLS). The test
              plan identifies high-level test objectives as well as the test procedures to be
              followed to achieve those objectives. These procedures include expected results. <h:br/>
              The test report (which could just be an annotated version of the test plan) details
              the activities that took place when the test procedures were executed, and includes
              the actual results of the tests. This shall be a cumulative account, so if there was a
              test run that resulted in a failure; a fix installed; and then a successful re-run of
              the test, the report would show a "fail" and "pass" result (and the supporting
              details), and not just the "pass" result.</aactivity>

      The documentation shall include a section that refers to each one of the unauthorized data flows listed
      in the appropriate data flow SFRs, how isolation is provided and how the risk is mitigated by the TOE.
      unauthorized data flow will be blocked. The document shall also provide justification for each method
      used based on the threats defined in Section 3.1 of this PP.
    </section>
    
    <section title="Firmware Dependencies">
      Documentation shall include a section dedicated to areas in the TOE where isolation strength depends
      on firmware functions. This shall describe how all microcontrollers or other components handle multiple
      data streams coupled to multiple computers. The documentation shall describe the methods used to
      assure that firmware failure would not result in catastrophic TOE data isolation failure.
